/* pages are authored with their own .page-inner wrapper (which may carry
   layout classes like title-page or sealed); inject content AND classes.
   The folio is then lifted out of the clipped, padded page-inner and into
   its parent (.page), which is exactly the reserved 7% strip book.css sets
   aside for it — the folio was never meant to compete with body text for
   the page's clipped space.

   Skips the rebuild entirely if the slot already shows this exact page
   (tracked via data-slug): page-turn.js's go() pre-fills the slot that
   will be revealed UNDERNEATH the flipping leaf partway through the turn,
   so the turn never ends on a bare/stale page — but render() then runs
   again once the turn completes and, being a generic "make both slots
   match the current spread" function, would otherwise redraw that SAME
   slot a second time for no visual reason. innerHTML churn tears down and
   rebuilds every element inside, which restarts any CSS animation (an SVG
   plate, say) from frame zero — so a reader would see it play for an
   instant during the turn, snap back to the start the moment the leaf
   settles, then play through properly. Skipping a no-op refill fixes that
   at the source rather than special-casing it in page-turn.js. */

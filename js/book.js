   the page's clipped space.

   Skips the rebuild entirely if the slot already shows this exact page
   (tracked via data-slug): page-turn.js's go() pre-fills the slot that
   will be revealed UNDERNEATH the flipping leaf partway through the turn,
   so the turn never ends on a bare/stale page — but render() then runs
   again once the turn completes and, being a generic "make both slots
   match the current spread" function, would otherwise redraw that SAME
   slot a second time for no visual reason. innerHTML churn tears down and
   rebuilds every element inside, which restarts any CSS animation (an SVG
   plate, say) from frame zero — so a reader would see it play for an
   instant during the turn, snap back to the start the moment the leaf
   settles, then play through properly. Skipping a no-op refill fixes that

/* The other half of the animation-restart fix above. fillSlot()'s
   dataset-slug guard protects the slot that was pre-filled UNDERNEATH the
   flipping leaf — but the leaf itself has its OWN two faces (#leafFront /
   #leafBack), and whichever face is facing the reader when the turn ends
   is what the real slot has to end up showing. That face has been
   carrying a live, already-running animation for the whole turn; calling
   fillSlot() for the real slot at that point would still rebuild it from
   the page's HTML string — a DIFFERENT element than the one that was just
   animating — restarting the animation exactly as before, just on the
   other side of the spread.

   Moving the leaf face's actual DOM nodes into the real slot (rather than
   rebuilding from the HTML string) gets the CONTENT across for free, but
   turns out not to be enough on its own: every engine tested here resets
   a CSS animation's clock on reparenting, same-tick appendChild included
   — it isn't only innerHTML churn that restarts one. So each animation's
   currentTime is read off the old elements a moment before the move, and
   wound forward onto the (new, but visually identical) Animation objects
   the moved elements get afterward — the clock is carried by hand since
   the browser won't carry it for us.

   The leaf face is left empty and its data-slug cleared so a future
   fillSlot() call on it (next turn) doesn't mistake "empty" for "already
   showing that page" and skip its own fill. */

/* The other half again — settleFromLeaf() (above) fixes the END of a
   turn; this fixes the START. .leaf's initially-visible face (leafBack
   for a backward turn, leafFront for a forward one — turnBack/turnFwd in
   page-turn.css start from opposite rotations) is filled, via fillSlot(),
   with a fresh DUPLICATE of content that's SIMULTANEOUSLY still showing,
   unchanged, in a real slot (pageL for a backward turn, pageR for
   forward — the leaf doesn't take over that slot until the turn
   completes, see go() in page-turn.js). fillSlot() builds that duplicate
   from the page's raw HTML string, which starts any CSS animation inside
   it at frame zero. The instant the leaf appears (z-index above the real
   pages), that fresh, frame-zero copy covers the original mid-animation
   — a visible jump from wherever the real one was to zero, at the exact
   moment a turn begins.

   Call right after fillSlot() builds that leaf face and before the real
   slot's own content is overwritten — reads each animated element's
   currentTime off the REAL slot (still showing that content, still
   ticking) and winds the newly-built leaf face's matching element
   forward to match. Copies rather than moves, unlike settleFromLeaf:
   the real slot has to go on showing that content untouched, in case the
   turn never completes (finishTurnNow() can cut one short, or in
   principle it could be interrupted). Matching is positional — leafFace
   was just built from the exact same HTML string as source's current
   content, so both element trees have identical shape. */

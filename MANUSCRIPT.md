[CLAUDE NOTES — INTERNAL ONLY, NOT BOOK CONTENT]
Everything inside a "[CLAUDE NOTES ...]" block, and every "[LIVE PAGE N]" tag appended
to a "[PAGE N ...]" header, is an internal annotation for Claude's own future reference.
None of this is manuscript text, is never read by loader.js/book.js, and must never be
copied into any page file in /pages. Purpose: (1) a vision-model description of every
image/animation placed in the book so far — type, what it depicts, what argument/beat it
illustrates, and the larger concept it ties to; (2) the actual LIVE page number (public
book.json order, 1-indexed, front matter included) each page/image/quote currently sits
on, so short-form video scripts can say "cut to page N" accurately. Live page numbers
below reflect book.json as of 2026-07-22 — re-derive them from book.json's order array
after any reorder/promotion before trusting a number here for a new script. Per explicit
instruction, this whole exercise only needs to track the LIVE public book (book.json),
not /dev — dev and public currently carry the identical order for Chapters I-II anyway.
Numbering rule (js/loader.js, numberFolios()): folio N = 1-based position of a slug in
book.json's "order" array, straight through, front matter included, no exclusions — this
was confirmed both by reading that source directly and by fetching the actual deployed
book.json (https://harveymeale9.github.io/RealityManual/book.json) on 2026-07-22, which
was byte-identical in "order" to the repo's book.json at that time. It also matches
pages/contents.html's own hardcoded folio numbers (4 for Ch. I, 13 for Ch. II). If a
number in this file ever looks wrong against what you see on-screen, re-check book.json's
CURRENT order first — it's the single source of truth these numbers are derived from —
before assuming the note is stale.
Chapter-opening full-bleed plates (Chapter1IllustrationDigitral.webp,
Chapter2IllustrationDigital.webp, and any later chapter's own opening plate) are
deliberately NOT annotated in detail below — atmosphere only, never used to explain a
concept, per explicit instruction.
A "STAGED / NOT YET PLACED" section at the end of this file covers image assets that
exist under assets/images and assets/svg but aren't in any built page yet (Chapter III
material) — no live page number is possible for those until they're placed.

[PULLQUOTE]
The tragedy lies not in defeat.
The tragedy lies in devoting oneself earnestly to a contest without first determining the conditions of victory.
[/PULLQUOTE]
[CLAUDE NOTES]
Quote location: this pull quote lives on LIVE PAGE 4 (nature-of-the-manual-opening),
directly beneath the chapter-opening plate and above the title. Strong standalone
"hook" quote — the book's very first spoken line — good for a reel's opening beat.
[/CLAUDE NOTES]
[DROPCAP OPENING]
No sensible person would sit down at a chessboard and begin playing before first understanding the objective of the game. No athlete would dedicate years to training for a competition without knowing how points are scored. No general would march an army into battle without first knowing what victory requires. The very suggestion is absurd.

They strive endlessly. They sacrifice. They worry. They plan. They pursue wealth, status, pleasure, security, virtue, power, knowledge, love, freedom, and countless other aims. They spend decades refining their strategies while neglecting to answer the single question upon which the value of every strategy depends: What, precisely, constitutes success within physical reality?
What does it mean to have existed well?
Most people have never seriously considered the question. Many assume the answer is unknowable. Others inherit an answer from their culture, religion, family, or peers.
[/BODY]
[/PAGE 2]

[PAGE 3 · pages/nature-of-the-manual-a-clear-answer.html — built] [LIVE PAGE 6]
[BODY]
Yet, if the purpose of one's existence remains unclear, how could one ever develop a robust strategy for achieving it?
The Reality Manual is arguably the only text in existence that establishes a clear, practical, and satisfactory answer to this question:
What does successful participation in physical reality actually look like?
In other words, what does it mean to win at the game of life?
Many texts offer guidance regarding how one ought to approach the game. Some contain profound insights. Others contain extraordinary wisdom. Yet they are often intertwined with mythology, cultural inheritance, historical circumstance, unverifiable metaphysical claims, moral prescriptions, and ideas whose relevance to modern life is uncertain. The result is that the signal is frequently buried beneath the noise, leaving the reader to excavate the principle from the surrounding doctrine.

[CLAUDE NOTES]
Image: TheBookLeadsTheWayIllustrationDigital.webp — LIVE PAGE 7, mid-page illustration.
Type: symbolic/allegorical full-width illustration on aged parchment (no diagram logic,
a visual metaphor scene), flanked by two columns of small icon roundels.
Depicts: a glowing open book radiating an eight-pointed star hovers at the seam between
a bright sunlit day-side landscape (mountains, waterfalls, a temple, an open archway/gate)
and a dark starry night-side (moon, ship at sea). A luminous winding path of light falls
from the book down through a labyrinth, past thorny brambles and gravestones, across a
chessboard, to a small hooded traveler with a walking staff standing at the path's foot
in the dark. Left icon column (top-to-bottom): broken/bleeding heart, eclipsed sun/eye,
open eye, lit lantern, infinity knot. Right icon column: star/compass, three interlocking
rings, scales of justice, compass rose, archer's hand+arrow. Bottom row: water drop, open
book, flame.
Explains: the book as guide through life's maze — labyrinth/thorns/graves = obstacles and
mortality, chessboard = the game-structure of reality, sunlit temple/open gate = clarity
and the destination the reader is walking toward. Pairs with this page's own line, "The
Reality Manual concerns itself only with that which is universal."
Larger concept: the "book leads the way" motif — the Manual as literal light/map through
darkness. The icon roundels double as a preview of major book themes (love, awareness,
judgment/scales, direction/compass, will, the elements). Very icon-dense — good candidate
for a reel that zooms into each roundel individually and names the concept it stands for.
[/CLAUDE NOTES]
[BODY]
It was written to be timeless, yet also practical and immediately applicable to the experience of everyday life. Its concern is not with the customs, beliefs, or circumstances of any particular culture, nation, religion, or historical period, but with those aspects of reality that remain true for every human being, in every place, at every time.
Every principle contained within these pages is intended to be useful to any individual who happens to find themselves incarnate in this physical reality.
[/BODY]
[/PAGE 4]

[PAGE 5 · pages/nature-of-the-manual-observation.html — built] [LIVE PAGE 8]
[BODY]
Its purpose is to help the reader understand the nature of the game in which they find themselves, the objective they are here to accomplish, and the optimal strategy for doing so.
Every principle contained within these pages, though often profound in its implications, can be verifiably proven accurate through direct observation of one's own experience of reality.
Nothing is to be accepted merely because it appears in this book. The reader is asked only to observe reality carefully enough to determine for themselves why the claims of the Manual are accurate.
[/BODY]
[ANIMATION https://realitymanual.com/assets/svg/eye-orbiting-globe.svg]
[CLAUDE NOTES]
Animation: eye-orbiting-globe.svg — LIVE PAGE 8, ambient looping SVG animation (NOT a
static raster image — this one moves continuously on the live page, screen-record it
rather than screenshot it for a reel).
Type: ambient/atmospheric looping animation, no text, no argument-diagram content.
Depicts: a wireframe orb/globe at the centre (a rotating grid of small dots around a
compass/eight-point rose glyph) orbited by four elliptical rings tilted at different
angles (like an armillary sphere), each carrying a single point that continuously
travels the ring at its own speed (11–20s loops). A larger outer elliptical path is
traced by a slow pulsing star (26s loop) with compass ticks at the cardinal points, plus
four small stars fading in and out at the corners. Rendered in the book's muted
brown/gold engraved-line palette (#A96F58 / #BCA063), matching the etched-illustration
look used throughout.
Explains: visualizes "observation" itself — a watching point of view continuously
orbiting reality — paired with this page's text on verifying every claim "through direct
observation of one's own experience of reality."
Larger concept: the patient, orbiting, watchful perspective the book asks the reader to
adopt, rather than blind acceptance. Best used as atmospheric b-roll/transition footage
in a reel rather than a "pinch and explain" beat, since it carries no discrete argument.
[/CLAUDE NOTES]
[BODY]
The Reality Manual demonstrates that many questions commonly assumed to be unanswerable are, in fact, resolved through careful observation.
[/BODY]
[/PAGE 5]
(mobile-only overflow: the closing sentence's final word, "observation.", was clipping on narrow viewports — the eye-orbiting-globe.svg partial has no width-narrowing style, so it renders at the full content column width on both breakpoints, and mobile's wider column (responsive.css's 7.5%-each-side padding vs desktop's 11%) meant the SVG rendered proportionally taller there too, eating more of the page than on desktop. Trimmed the svg's own viewBox from "20 52 160 96" to "20 57 160 86" — tightening the vertical crop around the existing artwork (which only ever used y 60.4-139.6 of the old 52-148 range, so nothing is cropped) rather than changing its on-page width, which shortens its rendered height on every breakpoint without shrinking it horizontally. Estimated to just clear one line's worth of missing text; not verified against an actual mobile render in this session.)

[PAGE 6 · pages/nature-of-the-manual-scope-of-this-volume.html — built] [LIVE PAGE 9]
[BODY]
This first volume concerns itself primarily with foundations. It establishes the first principles which govern reality, reveals the objective toward which successful participation in reality is directed, and derives from those principles the optimal strategy by which the game ought to be played.
Within these pages, you may recognize fragments of ideas you have encountered elsewhere. You may find echoes of older traditions, philosophies, religions, or schools of thought. Yet nowhere else have these ideas been gathered, refined, and assembled into a unified model of reality designed explicitly for practical application.
Ancient mysteries reveal themselves as ordinary features of reality, hiding in plain sight. Concepts normally regarded as abstract philosophy are translated into actionable knowledge. That knowledge forms the basis of an approach to reality capable of guiding an individual through the full spectrum of human experience.
[/BODY]
[ORNAMENT · ✦ ❦ ✦]
[BODY]
The Manual begins by establishing the single objective toward which all successful participation in this reality is directed, explaining in plain language what it is you are actually here to do.
Having established the objective, it then supplies the reader with the optimal strategy for accomplishing this objective.
The result is something far more valuable than a collection of ideas.
[/BODY]
[/PAGE 6]

[PAGE 7 · pages/nature-of-the-manual-the-second-volume.html — built] [LIVE PAGE 10]
[BODY]
It is a personal philosophy. A coherent way of acting inside reality on a daily basis. A way of showing up in the world that can be carried into every decision, every challenge, every relationship, and every moment for the remainder of one's life.
And it is precisely here that the true value of the Reality Manual begins to reveal itself.
For this volume is concerned not merely with what reality is, but with how reality works. It seeks to provide the reader with the map, the rules of the game, and the strategic principles from which intelligent action may be derived.
The Manual's second volume, yet to be published, concerns itself with the application of those principles. Where this volume establishes the strategy, the second demonstrates its use. Where this volume explains the game, the second explores the countless situations in which that understanding may be employed. It examines the practical problems, dilemmas, uncertainties, and decisions that confront every human being and demonstrates how an individual equipped with the Manual's principles is able to navigate them with clarity.
Most people accept suffering as an unavoidable feature of existence.
The Manual does not.
[/BODY]
[/PAGE 7]
(p6/p7 boundary: "The result is something far more valuable than a collection of ideas. It is a personal philosophy..." is one manuscript sentence-pair split across the page break — p6 was under budget, p7 was over, so the boundary moved back one sentence. Same for p7/p8 below: "Most people accept suffering... The Manual does not." moved from p8's opening onto p7's end for the same reason.)

[ILLUSTRATION https://realitymanual.com/assets/images/IgnoranceToImprisonmentDigital.webp]
[CLAUDE NOTES]
Image: IgnoranceToImprisonmentDigital.webp — LIVE PAGE 11, illustration opening the page
(exception to the usual "text both sides" placement — it's the page's first element,
with the [BODY] text that unpacks it following immediately after).
Type: 5-step vertical causal-chain infographic, illuminated-manuscript/gold-leaf style —
this is a labeled diagram, not pure atmosphere, and maps directly onto argument text.
Depicts: five circular vignettes stacked top-to-bottom, linked by small teardrop
ornaments, each numbered and captioned: (1) Ignorance — a blindfolded eye in clouds —
"The veiling of Awareness." (2) Confusion — a tangled Celtic-knot of rope/snakes — "The
mind entangles itself in endless knots." (3) Futility — a compass with a broken/erratic
needle over a maze-map — "Misguided action circles without progress." (4) Suffering — a
teardrop falling into a bowl of water — "The heart weeps for what the mind cannot
understand." (5) Imprisonment — a small chained, blindfolded figure inside an ornate
birdcage — "The soul forgets its freedom and calls the prison home."
Explains: this is a literal beat-by-beat diagram of the book's central causal thesis on
this very page — "ignorance generates confusion, that confusion generates a sense of
futility, and that futility is the source of all human suffering" — the diagram adds a
5th terminal step (imprisonment) beyond what the prose states outright: suffering
calcifying into a self-imposed, accepted prison.
Larger concept: THE foundational causal chain of Chapter I / the whole book's opening
argument for why life feels hard (ignorance -> confusion -> futility -> suffering ->
imprisonment). Extremely strong reel material — pinch into each of the 5 circles in
sequence while narrating the corresponding step; also works as 5 separate short clips,
one per stage.
[/CLAUDE NOTES]
[BODY]
It advances a different proposition: that suffering is not an intrinsic property of reality, but a consequence of ignorance regarding the nature of reality itself. That ignorance generates confusion, that confusion generates a sense of futility, and that futility is the source of all human suffering.
For how could one move confidently through a reality that appears chaotic, unpredictable, and fundamentally unknowable? How could one act decisively if success seemed arbitrary? How could one experience peace while believing oneself trapped inside a game whose rules remain hidden?
The Reality Manual proposes that the opposite is true. That reality is intelligible. That the game is understandable. That success is not nearly as mysterious as it first appears. And that as understanding increases, the sense of futility dissolves entirely.
What once seemed like a prison reveals itself to be a playground.

[/BODY]
[ILLUSTRATION https://realitymanual.com/assets/images/ConcentricCirclesPrisonToFreedomDigital.webp]
[CLAUDE NOTES]
Image: ConcentricCirclesPrisonToFreedomDigital.webp — LIVE PAGE 12, mid-page illustration.
Type: concentric-ring symbolic mandala (three nested layers, no text/captions — a pure
visual metaphor, unlike page 11's labeled diagram).
Depicts: a large circular composite scene. OUTER ring = a bright, lush landscape circling
the whole image — waterfalls, forests, a labyrinth garden, a ship at sea, sun on one
horizon and moon/stars on the other (a day-to-night sweep) — with small robed pilgrims
walking paths and doves flying. MIDDLE ring = a circular columned cloister/library where
robed scholars sit reading at desks, with an armillary sphere and a compass-rose emblem.
INNER/core = a dark stone dungeon at the very centre holding chained, blindfolded, caged
human figures around a knotted emblem, barred windows, and a locked gate at the bottom
threshold that a line of approaching pilgrims is walking toward.
Explains: visualizes this page's opening line — "one's experience of reality becomes
profoundly different once it is properly understood" — and directly echoes page 8's
closing line from the previous page, "What once seemed like a prison reveals itself to
be a playground." The three rings = ignorance/imprisonment at the core, study/scholarship
as the passage through it, and the free, open natural world beyond.
Larger concept: the book's "prison vs. playground" framing — study and observation are
the route from the confined inner self out to the free outer world. Good visual anchor
for a reel explaining that framing, or for a "layer by layer" pinch-out reveal (dungeon
-> library -> open world).
[/CLAUDE NOTES]
[BODY]
Such understanding must come first. For only when the nature of the game is understood does the pursuit of mastery become worthwhile. The first task, then, is to understand the structure of the game itself.
For until one understands the rules and the objective of the game, the optimal strategy may appear so contrary to conventional wisdom that it risks being dismissed before its validity can be properly appreciated.
[/BODY]
[/PAGE 9]
(p8/p9: "What once seemed like a prison reveals itself to be a playground." moved onto the end of p8 for the same reason as above; ONLY that one sentence moved, not both of p9's original opening paragraphs — p9's plate needs a paragraph in front of it too, per the images-couched-in-text rule, so p9 kept "The central promise of this text..." as its own lead-in rather than losing both.)

[TITLE]
The Structure of Reality: A Game
[/TITLE]
[ORNAMENT · ❦]
[DROPCAP OPENING]
The first claim of the Reality Manual is that physical reality possesses the structure of a game.
[/DROPCAP OPENING]
[BODY]
This conclusion is of extraordinary importance. For if reality is indeed structured as a game, then it follows that it may be understood in precisely the same manner as every other game.
It follows then that he who applies the appropriate game theory will maximize his chances of winning in life.
Before proceeding further, however, the claim itself that life is fundamentally a game must be evaluated.
[/BODY]
[/PAGE 10]
(this page was overflowing — "What qualities distinguish a game from every other form of experience?" was clipping mid-word at the bottom edge. Moved that whole sentence onto PAGE 11 instead; entry-opening pages in this book top out around 85 words across 4 paragraphs, notably less than docs/page-template.html's generic ~115-word guideline for this layout — see CLAUDE.md.)

[PAGE 11 · pages/chapter-2-two-characteristics.html — built] [LIVE PAGE 14]
[BODY]
For an activity to be considered a game, it must possess precisely two characteristics: interactivity and outcome asymmetry.

The most obvious of these qualities is interactivity.
[/BODY]

[CAPTION]
Game ⟹ (Interactivity ∧ Outcome Asymmetry)
[/CAPTION]
[CLAUDE NOTES]
Image: GameVenDiagramDigital.webp — LIVE PAGE 14, mid-page illustration with formal
caption. Type: two-circle Venn/logic diagram (sepia ink-line style), a labeled diagram
directly illustrating a formal argument, not pure atmosphere.
Depicts: left circle contains a hooded arm/hand reaching in to move a chess piece on a
chessboard ("Interactivity"); right circle contains an old balance scale, tipped unevenly
with weights outweighing an empty pan ("Outcome Asymmetry"). The circles overlap in the
centre. Caption beneath states the logical formula: "Game ⟹ (Interactivity ∧ Outcome
Asymmetry)".
Explains: this is the chapter's formal definition of a game, argued on this very page —
a game requires BOTH interactivity (the chess-moving hand) AND outcome asymmetry (the
unbalanced scale). Directly sets up the following page's argument that reality satisfies
both conditions.
Larger concept: the formal two-condition test for "is this a game" that the rest of
Chapter II's argument for "reality = a game" rests on. Good reel material for explaining
the book's definition of a game using just the two symbols (chess hand = interactivity,
scale = asymmetry).
[/CLAUDE NOTES]
[BODY]
A spectator watching a film possesses no meaningful influence over the events unfolding before him. The story proceeds according to a predetermined sequence regardless of his wishes, preferences, or intentions. A game is fundamentally different. A game responds to the actions of the participant. Inputs supplied by the player influence the outcomes that follow.
Reality plainly exhibits this characteristic. Every moment presents myriad possible actions. One may speak or remain silent. Advance or retreat. Create or destroy. Act or refrain from acting altogether. Different choices produce different outcomes. Reality is therefore very clearly interactive.
[/BODY]
[/PAGE 11]
(image moved off the very top of the page — house rule now is every plate needs body text both before AND after it on the same page, see CLAUDE.md. Added a formal caption beneath the plate stating the game-condition as a logical formula. The manuscript's own text growth on this page — "For an activity to be considered a game..." replacing the shorter original opening — plus the new caption pushed the page slightly over its image budget at the plate's original 75% width; narrowed the plate to 64% to bring it back within budget rather than move any body text off the page.)

[PAGE 12 · pages/chapter-2-outcome-asymmetry.html — built] [LIVE PAGE 15]
[BODY]
The second characteristic all games possess is outcome asymmetry. This simply means that some outcomes are more favorable than others.
Suppose one were to flip a coin fifty times, yet neither heads nor tails were regarded as more favorable than the alternative. This mindless fidgeting of metal constitutes no game at all, for its possible outcomes are perfectly symmetrical.
In the game of football, however, scoring a goal is generally considered more favorable than conceding one. In chess, checkmating one's opponent is generally considered more favorable than being checkmated. The distinction is obvious. An activity containing multiple outcomes, none of which are appraised as possessing greater value than another, cannot properly be regarded as a game.
The game of life most certainly contains asymmetrical outcomes. In a vacuum, health is more favorable than illness. Freedom is more favorable than imprisonment. Prosperity is more favorable to destitution. Joy is more favorable than misery.
Reality therefore satisfies both requirements. It is interactive, and it possesses outcome asymmetry. Any person of sound mind is left with little alternative but to conclude that reality possesses the structure of a game.
Once this conclusion has been reached, he who has a taste for that which is most favorable might then ask: How are games won?

One's probability of winning any game is a function of the effectiveness of the strategy one employs.
[/CAPTION]
[CLAUDE NOTES]
Image: ProbabiltiyOfVictoryDigital.webp — LIVE PAGE 16, mid-page illustration, sized large
(80% width, per manuscript note above — the biggest plate placement in the book so far).
Type: illuminated-manuscript ornamental banner/plaque — an equation rendered as a formal
illustration, not a scene or a labeled multi-part diagram.
Depicts: gold-leaf scrollwork border (red/blue/gold, fleur-de-lis finials) on parchment,
framing a single equation in elegant serif math type: "P(Victory) = f(E_s)". No other
imagery — purely decorative framing around the formula itself.
Explains: formalizes the page's own caption/pull-quote sentence — "One's probability of
winning any game is a function of the effectiveness of the strategy one employs" —
condensing the book's core strategic thesis into one equation.
Larger concept: THE single most quotable/shareable image in the book so far — the whole
strategic argument of Chapter II compressed into one formula. Ideal as a stand-alone
reel hook or IG tile ("this one equation is the whole book"), and as the numerator half
of a two-part reel that then cuts to page 17's OptimalStrategy formula for what E_s
(effective strategy) is actually built from.
[/CLAUDE NOTES]
[BODY]
Naturally, the most effective strategy can only be described as the optimal strategy.
The curious player then asks a further question: How might one go about developing the most optimal strategy for the game of life?
The answer is remarkably simple. Only two pieces of information must be known before an optimal strategy can be derived: the objective of the game and the rules which govern it.
[/BODY]
[/PAGE 13]
(the pull quote that used to live here — styled to match Chapter I's own, no decorative quote-mark, no attribution — is retired. Replaced with the P(Victory) = f(E_s) illuminated banner plate, and the quote itself demoted to that plate's caption, per explicit request; same raster-plate/plate-caption treatment as the Venn diagram on PAGE 11. The plate went through two widths — 53%, then explicitly requested up to 80% ("prioritize the image size, figure out the words later") — the second, much bigger size, meant the page's own prose pool had to shrink to make room: "The objective defines... deduction." moved off onto PAGE 14, which is the whole reason PAGE 14 exists in its current form — see its own note.)

[PAGE 14 · pages/chapter-2-threefold-purpose.html — built] [LIVE PAGE 17]
[BODY]
The objective defines what constitutes success, while the rules define the boundaries within which success must be pursued. Once these two elements are understood, strategy ceases to be a matter of speculation and becomes a matter of deduction.
The purpose of the Reality Manual is therefore threefold: to reveal the objective of the game, to reveal the rules by which the game operates, and to reveal the optimal strategy that may be derived from an understanding of both.
[/BODY]

(widened to ~68% per the manuscript note above — one of the largest plates in the book).
Type: three-input logic/derivation diagram with a formal implication statement, sepia
ink-illustration + gold ornamental banner.
Depicts: top-left, a chess bishop piece inside a circular compass-rose/starburst
medallion. Top-right, an open illuminated book inside a matching medallion. Arrows curve
down from both into a central gold banner reading "Optimal Strategy ⟹ (Objective ∧
Rules)". A third arrow rises into the banner from a compass-rose/star medallion below.
Explains: the direct visual restatement of this page's own text — "The purpose of the
Reality Manual is therefore threefold: to reveal the objective..., the rules..., and the
optimal strategy that may be derived from an understanding of both." The open book =
Rules, the compass below = Objective, feeding up into Optimal Strategy; the bishop
(top-left) reads as the player/pieces-in-play — tactical execution — as a third
contributing element.
Larger concept: formally extends page 16's P(Victory)=f(E_s) equation by showing what
E_s (effective strategy) is actually derived FROM. Excellent for a reel that chains the
two formulas: "first, victory is a function of strategy... here's the formula for what
makes a strategy optimal in the first place."
[/CLAUDE NOTES]
[BODY]
The present volume concerns itself principally with these foundational matters. The practical deployment of that strategy across the various domains of life shall be reserved for the second volume.

(the infographic briefly lived on its own dedicated page (see PAGE 14.5's retirement note below) but was asked to move back here instead, directly under the "...understanding of both." paragraph, with "The present volume..." moved to sit beneath it rather than above — per explicit request. That reunites this page's full original prose (107w/3p) around the plate. Went through four widths: 52% -> 58% (formula max) -> 73% (screenshot-scaled) -> 68%, backed off slightly from 73% because "The present volume..." was clipping on MOBILE specifically — same root cause as the earlier eye-orbiting-globe.svg mobile overflow (nature-of-the-manual-observation.html): a plate sized as a % of its own column renders at a bigger fraction of --page-w on mobile than on desktop, since mobile's column itself is wider (responsive.css's 7.5%-side padding vs desktop's 11%). A plate with an explicit width style is just as exposed to this as one with none — narrowing it slightly is the fix either way. Even at 68%, the last line of "The present volume..." was still about half cut off. Rather than narrow the plate further (which would keep shrinking a plate the user has repeatedly asked to keep large), reclaimed just that half-line by tightening this ONE plate's own top/bottom margin — `margin:calc(var(--page-w) * .031) auto` inline, down from the book-wide default `.045`. Explicitly a one-off exception for this plate, not a change to the shared `.plate-frame` rule in typography.css, which stays at `.045` for every other plate in the book.)

Most manuals concern themselves only with the first two tasks, explaining the objective and describing the rules while leaving the reader to determine strategy for himself.
This Manual relieves the reader of that burden by deriving the optimal strategy directly from the objective and the rules themselves.
Having established that strategy, the second volume shall concern itself with its practical application throughout the ordinary circumstances of life.
Throughout the pages that follow, the rules of reality shall be revealed: the underlying principles that govern the structure of the playing field itself. These are the metaphysical principles which define the boundaries within which the player operates, determine which actions advance him toward victory, and establish the consequences attached to his conduct. Only once these principles have been understood can an optimal strategy be deduced with confidence.
The objective of the game shall be presented in the forthcoming chapters, but not until the most foundational principle of reality has first been established.
For without this foundation, the objective appears far less self-evident than it truly is, and the optimal strategy cannot be recognized for what it truly is.

(this page used to be pages/chapter-2-deriving-the-optimal-strategy.html and carried the infographic itself — now retired/renamed to chapter-2-relieving-the-reader.html. Still visibly lighter than its facing page after 160w/5p, so pulled the rest of what was PAGE 15's opening paragraph forward too — 186w/6p now, at the confirmed-safe 6-paragraph count and comfortably under the 210-word ceiling.)

[BODY]
Once the objective, the rules, and the strategy derived from them have all been established, the first volume shall have completed its task. The second volume shall then concern itself with the practical question that naturally follows: how such a strategy is to be implemented within the realities of everyday life.

(down to a single paragraph, 51w/1p — very light, but this is the last page in the chapter's current run with nothing further to push into. A thin final page is the accepted trade-off of pulling PAGE 14.5 up to a normal fill level; flagging it rather than letting it pass unremarked.)

Running-head note: page count and positions are unchanged from the last pass (still 19 dev pages) — PAGE 14 and PAGE 14.5 swapped which content they hold, not their position in the order, so no running-head parity changes this time.

[Chapters I-II above are built and live on both /dev (dev/book.json) and the public book.json — Chapter II was promoted to public per explicit request, alongside afterword-more-to-come as the book's closing page (20th). dev/book.json and book.json now share the same "contents" page (contents-dev.html retired, no longer needed now that both books show Chapter II as live) and the same full running order. See CLAUDE.md's "Public book vs. dev book" section.]

[CLAUDE NOTES — FRONT MATTER, LIVE PAGES 1-3 & 20]
These four pages are not manuscript prose (no [PAGE N] entry above) but do carry live
page numbers and, on page 1, an image — noting them here for completeness since reel
scripts may reference them:
LIVE PAGE 1 — frontispiece-first-sigil.html — carries assets/svg/sigil.svg. Type: large
animated SVG seal/emblem (NOT raster, screen-record for a reel), the book's signature
recurring device. Depicts a 24-glyph outer ring (compass, north star, eye, path, knight,
scales, concentric circles, target, key, labyrinth, flame, hourglass, mountain, crown,
hand, lantern, telescope, anchor, bridge, arrow, spiral, tree, sun, moon) slowly
rotating; inside it, three orbiting medallions — a compass (Objective), a scale (Rules),
a chess knight (Strategy) — each linked by dotted gold "feed lines" with traveling
particles converging inward on a central pulsing book icon (the Manual itself), all
counter-rotating so every medallion stays upright. Larger concept: this is the book's
central thesis — Objective + Rules -> Strategy -> the Manual — rendered as a literal seal
before a single word of the book is read. The single most important "brand" visual in
the whole project; worth its own dedicated reel ("here's the whole book in one seal").
LIVE PAGE 2 — title-page.html — text only ("The Reality Manual", "Volume I: First
Principles"), no image.
LIVE PAGE 3 — contents.html — text only (table of contents), no image. Lists Chapter III
as "All That Is Valuable" and Chapter IV as "The Objective of Life", both marked
"forthcoming" — useful context for the staged Chapter III assets noted below.
LIVE PAGE 20 — afterword-more-to-come.html — text only, closing "still being written"
note, no image.

[CLAUDE NOTES — STAGED / NOT YET PLACED ASSETS]
The following image and SVG assets exist in the repo (assets/images, assets/svg) but are
NOT referenced by any manuscript page above and are NOT in any built /pages file or
book.json order yet — they have no live page number. Per contents.html, Chapter III is
titled "All That Is Valuable," which these assets clearly belong to (themes of emotion,
thought, and value). Annotated now, ahead of placement, so this note doesn't need to be
redone once Chapter III's manuscript text arrives — re-derive live page numbers at that
point.

Image: Chapter3IllustrationDigital.webp — staged, no live page.
Type: atmosphere/character illustration, matches the Chapter I/II opening-plate style —
almost certainly the Chapter III opening plate.
Depicts: a hooded robed figure (seen from behind) in a candlelit study, reaching up to
touch a glowing red heart-emblem pinned to a wall covered in a red-string "conspiracy
board" of pinned pictures/icons — a crown, treasure chest, laurel wreath, trophy, coins,
a couple embracing, a family portrait, jewels, a throne, a ship, buildings, books.
Explains/larger concept: visualizes "value" as a web of candidate objects (status, money,
love, family, achievement) all radiating out from — and secondary to — a single glowing
heart at the centre. Strong thematic fit for a chapter titled "All That Is Valuable":
the array of things people chase, versus the one thing (feeling/emotion, per the heart)
the book is about to argue is the actual source of value.

Image: ThoughtsServingEmotionDigital.webp — staged, no live page.
Type: labeled hierarchical/causal diagram (illuminated-manuscript style, text captions
present) — a formal argument diagram, not atmosphere.
Depicts: top medallion "Emotion" (a flaming heart) feeds down to "Thought" (an eye over
an open book), which branches into three medallions — "Eliminate" (ouroboros snake +
dagger), "Attain" (a star-lit sapling/tree), "Preserve" (a shield wreathed in laurel) —
which converge at the bottom into "Transformed Emotion" (a second flaming heart).
Explains: a full causal model — Emotion gives rise to Thought, which organizes itself
around three possible operations (eliminate/attain/preserve something), which in turn
produce a new, Transformed Emotion. Matches this asset's filename thesis: "thoughts serve
emotion" — thought is instrumental, not primary; its job is to act on the world so as to
change what is ultimately felt.
Larger concept: likely the core diagram for Chapter III's central argument about the
primacy of emotion over thought/circumstance — a prime "pinch into each medallion in
sequence" reel diagram once it has a live page.

Image: RuleOfInternalValue.webp — staged, no live page.
Type: small emblem/icon illustration (not a scene, not a labeled diagram) — reads as a
chapter-internal "rule sigil" companion to RuleOfInternalValueSigil.svg below.
Depicts: a faceted red gem/heart at the centre, topped by an eight-point star on a beam
of light, with three smaller motifs radiating from it — an octahedral gem (left), a
diamond (bottom), a rolled scroll/parchment (right).
Explains/larger concept: an emblem for "the Rule of Internal Value" — the heart as the
central jewel of worth, with money/possessions/knowledge (gem, diamond, scroll) as
secondary, radiating facets rather than the source itself.

SVG: RuleOfInternalValueSigil.svg — staged, no live page, but unusually self-documenting:
its own <title>/<desc> tags read "Rule 1 — The Rule of Internal Value" / "External
circumstances influence emotion; emotion alone is where value exists, within the
conscious self." This is very likely the FIRST of a series of numbered "Rule" sigils for
Chapter III onward (parallel to the frontispiece's book-level sigil.svg).
Type: large animated SVG seal (screen-record for a reel), built as two concentric zones.
Depicts: an OUTER rotating ring of twelve grey/monochrome wedges, each bearing an icon of
an external circumstance — dollar sign, crown, trophy, people, house, car, briefcase,
diamond, mountain, dress, medal, star — i.e. money, status, relationships, possessions,
achievement. An INNER cream/gold "emotion ring" counter-rotates, decorated with ten
alternating heart glyphs. At the very centre, a circle that rhythmically flashes between
cream-with-dark-figure and black-with-white-figure, containing a simple human bust/head
silhouette — "the conscious self" per its own <desc> — with faint dashed gold lines
pulsing inward from the emotion ring toward this core figure.
Explains: a literal animated diagram of the rule stated in its own <desc> — external
circumstances (outer grey wheel) act upon emotion (inner gold ring of hearts), and value
itself exists only at the core, within the conscious, feeling self (the flashing central
figure) — external things have no value except through the emotion they produce in a
person.
Larger concept: this is almost certainly the visual "seal" for Chapter III's first named
Rule of Reality, exactly parallel in construction to the frontispiece sigil.svg (outer
ring / orbiting or counter-rotating middle layer / pulsing core). Once placed, this is
prime material for a reel built entirely around explaining this one rule via its sigil —
zoom from outer wheel (circumstances) inward to the ring of hearts (emotion) to the
flashing core (the self, where value actually lives).

Image: candlestick.webp — staged, no live page.
Type: isolated object render on a transparent/white background (not a scene or diagram).
Depicts: a single ornate brass/bronze candlestick holder with a lit ivory candle, wax
dripping down its sides, burning low.
Larger concept/likely use: a reusable decorative asset (not a chapter-specific argument
image) — probably intended as a recurring motif or UI/decorative element (e.g. an
"unlit/lit" reading-progress indicator, a chapter-transition flourish, or similar), given
its isolated-object rendering versus the parchment-scene style of every other plate in
the book. Flagging rather than assigning it a concept, since nothing in the manuscript or
built pages currently uses it — confirm its intended purpose before scripting around it.

Not annotated here (confirmed non-content UI chrome, not book illustrations):
assets/svg/cursor.svg and assets/svg/cursor-point.svg — small custom mouse-cursor glyphs
(a quill-nib shape) used for page-turn interaction, not reel material.
